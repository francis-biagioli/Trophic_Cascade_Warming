README FILE

This project includes code used to fit ODE models using Stan, process and analyze posterior outputs, calculate trophic cascade strength, and generate figures for analysis and publication.

Note: You may need to adjust file paths to ensure data loads properly when running each .Rmd file.

STEP 1: IMPORT RAW TIME SERIES DATA
-Place the CSV file containing time series data into the main project folder.
-The data should include the following columns:
  -Jar ID: Unique identifier for each replicate
  -Community ID: Describes community structure (P-A for 2-species treatment; H-P-A for 3-species treatment)
  -Block: Replicate block
  -Date: Date of data collection
  -Species: Species name
  -Count: Observed species count
  -Volume: Volume counted

STEP 2: RUN STAN FITS
-Navigate to the Fitting/ folder, which contains .Rmd and .stan files used to run Stan models.
-File/folder naming conventions:
  -Files starting with DA refer to 2-species communities (no Hydra top predator).
  -Files starting with HDA refer to 3-species communities (with Hydra top predator).
  -The number following DA or HDA indicates the temperature treatment.
  
-Each folder contains:
  -An .Rmd file that reads and manipulates the raw data, runs Stan models, and saves outputs.
  -A .stan file with the Stan model code.

-Running the .Rmd files will:
  -Save the Stan fit object.
  -Save a .csv file of posterior draws (one row per MCMC iteration).
  -Save a .csv of posterior summary statistics for each parameter.

STEP 3: ORGANIZE STAN OUTPUT
-Navigate to Fitting Output/Draws/ to process output files.
-Files here combine posterior draws and summary statistics across temperature and community treatments.

-Combine_Posterior_Data.Rmd: Saves two .csv files:
  -One with posterior estimates from all 2-species treatments.
  -One with posterior estimates from all 3-species treatments.

-Posterior_Summary.Rmd: Saves a single .csv file containing summary statistics (e.g., median, CI) for all estimated parameters across all treatments.

NOTE: Large Data files needed to be compressed before uploading data. Extract the data from the .zip files before continuing to next step.

STEP 4: CALCULATE ODE SOLUTIONS FROM POSTERIOR SUMMARIES
-Navigate to Fitting Output/ODE Output/.

-Run ODE_Solutions.Rmd to:
  -Calculate ODE solutions using median values from the posterior distributions.
  -Save a .csv file with ODE solutions for both 2- and 3-species models across temperature treatments.

STEP 5: CALCULATE TROPHIC CASCADE STRENGTHS
-Navigate to the TC_Strength/ folder.

-This folder contains:
  1)TC_Strength_From_Sol.Rmd
    -Uses ODE solutions to calculate trophic cascade strength over time for each temperature.
    -Saves five .csv files, one for each temperature.

  2)TC_Strength_Posterior_Data.Rmd
    -Computes the average trophic cascade strength across the full time series for each temperature treatment.
    -Saves a .csv file with 6000 posterior estimates per temperature treatment.
    
STEP 6: RUN LINEAR REGRESSION ANALYSIS ON POSTERIOR DISTRIBUTIONS OF MEAN TROPHIC CASCADES
- Navigate to the TC Strength/Posterior Analysis/ folder.

- Run "TC_Change_With_Temp.Rmd" file to:
    - Run the linear regression analysis described in the Methods section of the main text and expanded on in the Supplimentary Materials S4
    - Save a plot vidualizing the posterior distribution of slopes output from the analysis.

STEP 6: CREATE PLOTS
-Navigate to the Figures/ folder to generate all project figures.

-Available files:
  1)Full_Dynamics_Sol_Plots.Rmd: Saves plots of time series dynamics for each treatment.
  2)Pars_Violin.Rmd: Saves violin plots showing posterior distributions of all estimated parameters.
  3)TC_Strength_Plots.Rmd: Saves plots of trophic cascade strength over time and average cascade strength for each treatment.

STEP 7: GENERATE SUPPLIMENTAL FIGURES AND TABLES
-Navigate to the Supplemental Figures/ folder.

-Includes files to:
  1)Create trace plots for each estimated parameter.
  2)Generate summary statistic tables from Stan fits.
